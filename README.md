# MATCOR
One of the challenges in data analysics and data mining is the verification of the quality of the input data. Especially for large datasets it is not feasible to check each datum and automatization of this task is desirable. MATCOR (MATerials CORrelation) is a software to automate inter-database property validation/verification by finding the closest matching materials in two TestAPI supporting materials databases. The software in this repository is adjusted for materials verification between Materials Project (https://materialsproject.org/) and AFLOW (http://www.aflowlib.org/).

The implemented search strategy is based on materials meta-data to reduce the number of structure comparisons.
